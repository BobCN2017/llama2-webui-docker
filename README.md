# Introduction
This project dockerises the deployment of [BobCN2017/llama2-webui](https://github.com/BobCN2017/llama2-webui) and its variants. It provides a default configuration (corresponding to a vanilla deployment of the application)

*This goal of this project is to be to [BobCN2017/llama2-webui](https://github.com/BobCN2017/llama2-webui), what [AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker](https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker) is to [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).*

# Usage
*This project currently supports Linux as the deployment platform. It will also work using WSL2.*

## Pre-Requisites
- docker
- docker compose
- CUDA docker runtime

## Docker Compose
This is the recommended deployment method (it is the easiest and quickest way to manage folders and settings through updates and reinstalls). The recommend variant is `default` (it is an enhanced version of the vanilla application).
